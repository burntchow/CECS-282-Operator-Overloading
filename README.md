# CECS-282-Operator-Overloading
## Project 4

Test file - testupDate.cpp written by my professor Steven H. Gold 

Remember that Calendar project from before? Yeah? Well now it's better.
Overloading operators so that it will be possible to add dates, subtract dates, convert from Gregorian to Julian and vice versa on upDate objects, verify dates.
